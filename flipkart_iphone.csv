5,Perfect product!,Amazing phone with great cameras and better battery which gives you the best performance. I just love the camera .
5,Great product,"Amazing Powerful and Durable Gadget.

I‚Äôm am very happy with the camera picture quality, Amazing face id unlocked in dark room, Strong battery with perfect screen size as you can carry easily in pocket. This is my third iPhone.

I shifted from android Samsung Note series to iPhone because of the strong build quality and peace of mind for next 3-4 years.

Don‚Äôt think to much just go for it and I suggest you to go for minimum 128gb variant or more 256gb.

5,Perfect product!,"It‚Äôs a must buy who is looking for an upgrade from previous generation of iPhones. If you are using XR then still you can hold on for sometime and upgrade to 2020 model else this phone is a must buy . Camera quality is amazing and wide angle is something to count upon. Performance wise it‚Äôs amazing and feels premium while holding in hand. So a big YES for this device. Go for 128 GB variant as the 4K videos will occupy lots of space and the storage can get over very quickly. Try to buy it with...

5,Highly recommended,"iphone 11 is a very good phone to buy only if you can compromise for the display. The display on this is device is pretty good but you can get other options with better displays in this price segment.
If you can survive with an HD+ LCD panel with thicker bezels and a notch up top then this is a very good phone for you.
Cameras are awesome, battery backup excellent, great performance and a decent premium look. Good job Apple !"

5,Wonderful,"*Review after 10 months of usage*
Doesn't seem bulky with decent touch and camera. The ""standard maintained"" quality of IPhone. Go for it, if your budget is not more enough for pro models. It's a value for money among the 11 series Stereo speakers are so good, you will love the stereo sound. Battery backup is not decent but still better than Iphone 7 and 8.Processor is fast, the phone doesn't lag at all even with heavy games, waterproof, faster face id and with no fingerprint scanners.

5,Mind-blowing purchase,"This will help you more. See if you are planning to buy iPhone 11. I will say. Yes. But there are some plans I just want to disclose before you buy. 1) If you are an existing iPhone X/XS/XS Max/ XR user, better you guys do not think it to buy. You guys have more or less better gadget. 2) If you are an android user and planning to buy premium phone. I will suggest them to please buy iPhone instead of buying an Android.

5,Wonderful,This is my first ever I phone. Before this I was using my google nexus 5. But moving from android to iOS is a great experience. It‚Äôs worth at this price. I will highly recommend it if you want to move to iOS. The best part of this phone is it‚Äôs camera and it‚Äôs battery life. This two things have won my heart. I loved it. Happy to have it in my hand. Still exploring its features. And can‚Äôt forget to mention Flipkart service. Very prompt service and fast delivery.
5,Great product,"Well you all know the specifications . One of a kind. Best iPhone till date. Many enhancements to the camera app with many options. Love the glass body with matte finish in the lens area on the back. Lovely colours to choose from. Best battery in an iPhone till date, enough to last more than a day in normal usage. I tested my iPhone 11 battery and lasted for than 24 hours after full charge still with 30% battery charge left. Watched movies for some time. Normal usage on calls, browsing, musi...

This phone not only for good quality photography but a lot of other task too.üòçüíØ"
5,Terrific purchase,"The built quality is not very premium.
The battery back is great .
The LCD panel is not so sharp but the brightness level is very High .
Camera is super duper awesome.
The red colour which people think is bright is actually very soothing and excellent colour to choose from .
The A13 Bionic chip is really a flagship processor and can beat any phone which even has 12 gb ram .
Camera module is very great and looks very stylish."
5,Mind-blowing purchase,"First thanks to Flipkart for this amazing deal and phone is outstanding. I upgraded from iPhone 7 and this is like very big upgrade. But the packaging was very basic I expected a good packaging as they only wrapped one layer of bubble wrap which I don‚Äôt think is enough to protect this expensive phone. And I recommend this phone and seller as well.

And I‚Äôm posting this review after using it for 4 days."

The mobile will heat up like a stove sometimes. You cannot even play Pubg even in low settings properly, performance is not a problem but heating is. Also if you play that game for 10 mins the brightness will be automatically down due to over heating even when the auto brightness is set to off. This will not be solved even if u manually increase the bri...

5,Just wow!,Best in class. Battery backup is good especially when you play games like Pubg COD. But it is sort of heavy when you hold in hands. Portrait mode is best to click pictures. Stage light effect is awesome. Try to click photos outside in nature because photos inside home or room will not give you the quality in any phone even in DSLR.
